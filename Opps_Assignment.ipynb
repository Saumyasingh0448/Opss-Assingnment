        "# **Python OOPs Questions**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "-  Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming approach that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes. It focuses on four key principles:\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods into one unit and restricting direct access.\n",
        "Inheritance: Allowing one class to inherit properties and methods from another.\n",
        "Polymorphism: Using a single method in different ways for different objects.\n",
        "Abstraction: Hiding complex details and showing only essential features.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "-  A class in OOP is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects will have. Objects are instances of a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "-  An object in OOP is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity with its own attributes (data) and methods (functions) defined by the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "- Abstraction hides implementation details and shows only the essential features, focusing on what an object does.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation protects data by restricting access and bundling it with methods, focusing on how the object’s data is controlled.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "- Dunder methods (short for \"double underscore methods\") in Python are special methods with names that start and end with double underscores (e.g., __init__, __str__).\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  Explain the concept of inheritance in OOPH?\n",
        "- Inheritance in OOP allows one class (child) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent). It promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism in OOP means the ability of different objects to respond to the same method in their own way, making code more flexible and reusable.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "- Encapsulation in Python is achieved by restricting access to an object's data using private variables and providing controlled access through methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Prefix attributes with __ (double underscore) to make them private.\n",
        "Use getter and setter methods to access or modify private data.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "- A constructor in Python is a special method called __init__() that automatically runs when an object is created. It initializes the object’s attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "- 1. Class and Static Methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "Class Method: Works with the class, not instances. Uses @classmethod and takes cls as the first argument.\n",
        "Static Method: Independent of class/instance. Uses @staticmethod and doesn't take self or cls.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "-  Method Overloading:\n",
        "\n",
        "Defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. Python handles this with default arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "- Method Overriding:\n",
        "\n",
        "In inheritance, a child class redefines a method from the parent class to provide its own implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "- Property Decorator:\n",
        "\n",
        "@property makes a method act like an attribute, allowing access without parentheses.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "- Importance of Polymorphism:\n",
        "\n",
        "Allows the same method to work with different objects, making the code more flexible and reusable.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "- An abstract class in Python is a blueprint for other classes. It cannot be instantiated directly and may contain one or more abstract methods — methods that are declared but have no implementation in the abstract class.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "- Advantages of OOP:\n",
        "\n",
        " Modularity: Organizes code into classes, making it easier to manage.\n",
        " Reusability: Inheritance reduces code duplication.\n",
        " Encapsulation: Protects data by controlling access.\n",
        " Abstraction: Hides complex details, showing only what’s needed.\n",
        " Polymorphism: Enables flexibility by allowing the same interface for different objects.\n",
        " Maintainability: Simplifies updates and debugging.\n",
        " Scalability: Supports building complex, reusable code structures.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "- Class Variable: Shared by all instances of the class. Defined at the class level and accessed through the class or instances.\n",
        "Instance Variable: Unique to each instance (object) of the class. Defined inside the __init__ method and accessed through the instance.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "18.  What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "- Multiple inheritance in Python is a feature that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. This enables a child class to combine functionalities from multiple base classes. It is implemented by specifying multiple parent classes in parentheses during class definition.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n",
        "- The __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python are special methods used to define how objects are represented as strings.\n",
        "\n",
        "__str__ (str() function or print() output)\n",
        "\n",
        "Used for a user-friendly, readable string representation of an object.\n",
        "Should be easy to understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "20.  What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "- The super() function in Python is used to call a method from a parent (or superclass) within a child class. It is commonly used in inheritance to avoid explicitly naming the parent class, making the code more maintainable and supporting multiple inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Uses of super():\n",
        "Access parent class methods without directly specifying the parent class name.\n",
        "Avoid redundant code by reusing parent class functionality.\n",
        "Supports multiple inheritance by following the Method Resolution Order (MRO).\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The __del__ method in Python is a special method, also known as a destructor, that is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It is used to release resources, such as closing files or network connections, before the object is garbage collected.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Points:\n",
        "Called automatically when an object is deleted or goes out of scope.\n",
        "Helps in cleanup operations like closing files, releasing memory, or disconnecting from a database.\n",
        "Not always reliable because garbage collection timing varies.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "- @staticmethod\n",
        "\n",
        "Does not take self (instance) or cls (class) as parameters.\n",
        "Cannot modify instance or class attributes.\n",
        "Used for independent utility methods inside a class.\n",
        "@classmethod\n",
        "\n",
        "Takes cls (class reference) as the first parameter.\n",
        "Can modify class attributes but not instance attributes.\n",
        "Used when a method needs to interact with class-level data.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "- Polymorphism allows different classes to have methods with the same name, enabling objects to be treated interchangeably. In inheritance, it enables a child class to override or extend the behavior of a parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "- Method chaining is a technique in object-oriented programming where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single statement. It is achieved by having each method return self (the instance), allowing subsequent method calls.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The __call__ method allows an instance of a class to be called like a function. This makes objects behave like callable functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Points:\n",
        "Defined using def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs).\n",
        "Allows objects to be invoked directly using parentheses ().\n",
        "Useful for creating function-like objects or custom decorators.\n",
        "\n",
